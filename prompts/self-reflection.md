# Self Reflcetion
Go over the chat history and analyse the interaction between the assistant and the user. Focus on miscommunication between the user and the assistant. Understand the root cause of the misunderstandings and identify what information was missing in order to have a commom understanding.

Then formulate a process for ensuring appropriate context is in place to not end up in similar misunderstandings in the future. The end goal should be to produce a set of rules that could be included in the copilot-instructions.md file so that the assistant workflow is improved and improve the assistant user interaction and lead to a better outcome faster.

The resulting instructions should consider all existing and new instructions holistically and not contain any conflicting or ambigous rules. If there are important rules that may conflict, order them from most to least important.

Afterwards, update the copilot-instructions.md file with the latest rules.
